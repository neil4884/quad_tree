./tree_graphics.tex:1: LaTeX Error: Environment tikzpicture undefined.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.

Your command was ignored.
Type  I <command> <return>  to replace it with another command,
or  <return>  to continue without it.

./tree_graphics.tex:2: Undefined control sequence.
l.2     \node
             [circle, draw] {Parent}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

You're in trouble here.  Try typing  <return>  to proceed.
If that doesn't work, type  X <return>  to quit.
